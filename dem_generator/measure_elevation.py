"""Acceptance report for the generated heightmap.

Checks the things that are easy to break and hard to see in the image: that the canvas is
the size and encoding the rest of the project expects, that nothing touches the floor or
the ceiling of the 16-bit range, that the playable square really is the datum rather than
nearly it, that the valley rim in the border is the valley the brief asked for - two
ranges standing 200 to 250 m over a floor at 20 m, a sill low enough at either end that
the valley runs through rather than being walled in - and that `terrain_stats.json`,
which the parcelling reads instead of re-deriving the terrain, describes the same surface
the PNG does.

The rim is the interesting half, and every number it is judged on is read back out of the
PNG. Only the *masks* come from the layout, through `terrain_ops.rim_field` - the same
call the generator shaped the rim with - because a second opinion about where the west
range is would be a report that passes a rim which is not the one that got built.

Exits non-zero if any check fails, so it can gate the pipeline.

One measurement note that outlives the blank map: slope is measured over a 5 m baseline.
A DEM quantised to the centimetre at one metre a pixel has a pure noise floor near 0.3
degrees in its per-pixel gradient, so measuring pixel to pixel overstates every slope on
the map. And dry land starts one baseline back from any water's edge - a 5 m window
straddling the lip reads the submerged bank off a pixel that is itself dry.
